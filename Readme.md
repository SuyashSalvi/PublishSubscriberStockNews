Stock Market Notifications System Using Publisher-Subscriber Mechanism

Overview

This project implements a real-time stock market notification system using a Publisher-Subscriber (Pub-Sub) mechanism to deliver instant stock updates to traders and investors. The system is built with Express.js, Spring Boot, React.js, and MongoDB, ensuring scalability, efficiency, and low-latency updates. It is deployed on AWS EC2 for high availability and performance.

Key Features
	â€¢	Real-time Stock Alerts â€“ Sends notifications based on user-defined stock preferences.
	â€¢	Scalable Pub-Sub Architecture â€“ Efficient message distribution across multiple subscribers.
	â€¢	Dynamic Data Streams â€“ Continuously fetches and updates stock price data.
	â€¢	Event-Driven Backend â€“ Uses Spring Boot & Express.js for concurrent stock data processing.
	â€¢	Interactive UI â€“ Built with React.js for stock monitoring and subscription management.
	â€¢	Cloud Deployment â€“ Hosted on AWS EC2 to ensure reliability and performance.

Technologies Used

Backend
	â€¢	Express.js â€“ API handling, user authentication, and notification distribution.
	â€¢	Spring Boot â€“ Manages stock data processing and event-driven notifications.
	â€¢	MongoDB â€“ Stores subscription details and historical stock data.

Frontend
	â€¢	React.js â€“ Provides an intuitive dashboard for monitoring stocks and managing subscriptions.

Infrastructure & Cloud
	â€¢	AWS EC2 â€“ Ensures scalable deployment and high performance.

How It Works
	1.	Stock Data Collection â€“ Fetches real-time stock price updates from external APIs.
	2.	Publisher-Subscriber Mechanism â€“ The backend publishes stock updates, which are received by multiple subscribers.
	3.	Real-Time Alerts â€“ Users receive notifications when stock prices reach predefined thresholds.
	4.	Cloud Deployment â€“ Hosted on AWS EC2 for optimal scalability and availability.
